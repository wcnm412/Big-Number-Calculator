Known issues:
  - Exponentiation of a negative integer immediately falls back to a double due to current implementation of overflow detection

To add:
  - Make this a general-purpose calculator with ~~add, subtract, multiplication, division,~~ logarithm, etc.
  - Include a GUI
  ~~- Split into multiple files for better readability~~
  - Browse history, including past *base* numbers and the result of operations on them
  - Allow multiple operations and numbers to be chained together, e.g. a * b + c / d
    - Ask user to enter a string, and interpret string as a series of numbers and operations
